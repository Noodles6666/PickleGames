#  [JOIN] signs:
#  To create a clickable sign to join an arena, use the following format:
#    |                   |
#    |       [JOIN]      |
#    | <GameType>:<Data> |
#    |                   |
#  For the <Data> section, the following can be used:
#    Case A: Join the first available arena (Default, if <Data> is left blank)
#    Case B: Join the nearest arena relative to the sign location
#    [Number]: Join a specific arena id (Ex: "Tic Tac Toe:4")
#
#  Example: (Joins the nearest soccer arena)
#    |                   |
#    |       [JOIN]      |
#    |      Soccer:B     |
#    |                   |
